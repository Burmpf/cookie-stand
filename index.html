<figcaption>Pat and the family he rescued from Ohio</figcaption>
<p>Pat, like all other Pats' before him, were raised with a deep respect for our fishy friends and a deep hatred for the animals who prey on them. Pat the 6<sup>th</sup> was the first Pat to take actions against their adversaries. He formed the B.O.S.S. (Bear and Otter Surgical Strike-team) in 2008 in an effort to support a good cause and to employ hunters during a difficult time in our economy. </p>
